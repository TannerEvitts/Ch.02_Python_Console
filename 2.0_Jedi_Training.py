'''
a=2
b=5

print(b/a) # 2.5
print(b//a) # 2
print(b**a) # 25
print(b%a) # 1
print(a+b) # Error B is not defined after fixed 7
print(type(42)) # int
print(type(42.0)) # float
print(type("C3PO")) # str
print(type(True)) # bool

3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines

'''
a=2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
a
type(a)
# a is 15

4.) What is the mistake in the following code. Fix it!
'''
x,y=(4,5)
a=3*(x+y)
print(a)
# there is spaces between the equal and plus sign sign in line 39 and 40 and there was no multiplication
# sign between the parentheses and 3
'''
5.) What is the mistake in the following code so it will calculate the average. Fix it!
'''
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave=(x+y+z/3)
